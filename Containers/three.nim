  Find the number in a range from 2 to 100 which will produce the longest Collatz sequence.
  1  For each number in the given range calculate its Collatz sequence
  2  If the length of current sequence is longer than the previous record,
      save the current length and the starting number as a new record
      (you can use the tuple (longestLength, startingNumber) or two separate variables)
  3  Print the starting number which gives the longest sequence, and its length
