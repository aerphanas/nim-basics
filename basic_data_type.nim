  1. Create an immutable variable containing your age (in years). Print your age in days. (1 year = 365 days)
  2. Check if your age is divisible by 3. (Hint: use mod)
  3. Create an immutable variable containing your height in centimeters. Print your height in inches. (1 in = 2.54 cm)
  4. A pipe has a 3/8 inch diameter. Express the diameter in centimeters.
  5. Create an immutable variable containing your first name, and another one containing your last name.
      Make a variable fullName by concatenating the previous two variables.
      Donâ€™t forget to put a whitespace in-between. Print your full name.
  6. Alice earns $400 every 15 days. Bob earns $3.14 per hour and works 8 hours a day, 7 days a week.
      After 30 days, has Alice earned more than Bob? (Hint: use relational operators)
